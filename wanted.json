		"caution": "<p>Francisco Molina-Neave is being sought for assault and the prohibited use of a weapon. Reports in this case allege the following: On July 5, 1997, Francisco Molina-Neave and his girlfriend attended a holiday party in the Denver Metro area. While driving home from the party, Molina-Neave, who was seated in the front passenger seat, began punching his girlfriend as she was driving. She stopped the car and pulled over. Molina-Neave got out and walked around to the driver\u2019s side of the car where he continued to beat his girlfriend.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The assault continued until a passer-by showed up and ran over to the girlfriend. Molina-Neave then fled the area. The passer-by flagged down a vehicle occupied by additional witnesses who reportedly saw the beating. The passer-by asked the witnesses in the car to attempt to locate the suspect. They agreed to help and spotted Molina-Neave a short distance away. They told Molina-Neave to stop and that they had called the police. The suspect fled down an alley as police arrived. While setting up the perimeter the police heard two gunshots fired from the alley where the suspect was last seen. The gunshots were fired by two different guns. The officers observed the witness vehicle speed out of the alley. The witnesses were screaming that the same suspect, along with another Hispanic male, had allegedly shot at them and their vehicle. One of the occupants in the vehicle was screaming that she had been shot as well.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 1999, a jury found Francisco Molina-Neave guilty on charges of first degree assault, attempted first degree assault, prohibited use of a weapon, and third degree assault. Molina-Neave fled from the courtroom as the verdict was read. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. On May 17, 2006, Francisco Molina-Neave was arrested on the warrant from Denver in San Antonio, Texas. He refused extradition, and a Texas court allowed him to post bond pending his extradition appeal. The suspect failed to appear and was arrested in mid-May of 2007. The Texas court set his bond for one million dollars. Molina-Neave posted the bond and was released. His appeal was denied on October 4, 2007, and he fled again. On March 13, 2008, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Molina-Neave, and he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>",

The two had been at this location, which was extremely dark, for a short time, waiting for a friend, before falling asleep in the vehicle. Their seats were reclined and the vehicle was off. Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim\u2019s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",

The victim was lost and had stopped on the highway shoulder to update her GPS. The offender approached her driver\u2019s side window and asked if she was okay. He then ordered her out of the vehicle and displayed a handgun, possibly a small compact, black, semi-automatic. The suspect ordered the victim to the backseat of his vehicle, described as a late model Jeep Cherokee, or similar, gray or blue in color with cloth fabric. The victim was sexually assaulted in the backseat of the suspect\u2019s vehicle. After the assault, the victim was ordered out of the car and left at the side of the road. The suspect was last seen making a U-turn and driving back towards Boulder.</p>\r\n<p>The victim did not recall seeing the suspect\u2019s vehicle on the shoulder when she first stopped and did not see the suspect\u2019s vehicle pull up behind her. The description of the suspect is vague, and it is believed he was a white male, approximately 5\u201911\u201d in height.</p>\r\n<p>After further interviews with the victim, she was able to provide additional details about the offender: a white male with longer; bondish arm hair. He had rough hands similar to a person who works with his hands. She described a tattoo on his upper left arm, possibly green in color, circle shape. She was only able to see the lower portion of the tattoo, due to a short-sleeve shirt covering the rest of the tattoo.</p>",

Diaz-Juarez is one of these pimps. During the investigation, it was revealed that some women and girls were compelled into performing commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, coercion, or a combination thereof, including the use of locked rooms to maintain control over the young women and girls. Diaz-Juarez used force and/or violence to punish and control young females he prostituted in the Houston area.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2013, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, after Diaz-Juarez was charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy and conspiracy to harbor illegal aliens.</p>",

They checked into the Amana Holiday Inn (along Interstate 80, just outside of Williamsburg) that evening and were found deceased the following afternoon by the motel maid. The victims had been stabbed to death, possibly with an axe or hatchet that had a 3 \u00bd inch blade. The male victim had seven stab wounds to his arms, hands, face, head, and neck/throat (including possible defensive wounds to his hands). The female victim had twelve stab wounds to her face, head, and neck/throat. There were no signs of forced entry into the motel room and no obvious signs of sexual assault. The victims were in bed, face-down, partly under the covers. The male victim was wearing only his underwear and the female victim was fully clothed. The victims\u2019 personal belongings were scattered and approximately $200 was taken. Small pieces of a bar of bath soap were on the floor next to the bed. The word \"this\" was printed on the bathroom door, possibly using the bar of soap, and toothpaste was squeezed into the bathtub. Investigators have identified two cases with similarities to the instant case: the homicide of a 25-year-old male in Galesburg, Illinois, on June 24,1980 and the homicide of a 23-year-old male in Meridian, Mississippi on\u00a0October\u00a026, 1970. Like the instant case, the Galesburg and Meridian victims were away from home and staying in a motel room just off a busy Interstate. Additionally, in all three cases, toothpaste was found in an unusual location at the crime scene, the weapon used is believed to be a machete or sort of axe/hatchet, and money was taken.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>If you have information relevant to this investigation, or know of other cases that resemble the details of this homicide (e.g., victim(s) was killed in a motel room near a busy interstate; weapon used was an axe, hatchet, or machete; toothpaste or soap was found in an unusual location at the crime scene; writing or drawings were left at the crime scene), please contact the agency below.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>&lt;p&gt;To provide or request additional information, please contact:\u00a0Captain Todd\u00a0Sauerbrei, Iowa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Iowa, (319) 642-7307, TSauerbrei@iowacosheriff.org - - FBI\u00a0ViCAP, (800) 634-4097, vicap@fbi.gov\u00a0</p>",

The male was discovered floating in the Sacramento River and is believed to have been deceased for a few hours. He was wearing blue pants, a navy-blue jacket, a white shirt, and brown ankle boots. The autopsy identified the following:<br />- Prosthetic right eye<br />- 10-inch long, well-healed scar on his mid-left abdominal wall<br />- Left kidney had been surgically removed<br />- Benign tumor beneath his sternum/breastbone<br />- Coronary artery disease<br />- Signs of emphysema<br />- Gallbladder contained three large stones<br />It is likely these medical conditions had been diagnosed by a doctor and may have been known by those close to him.

Pratt also allegedly paid other young women working at his and his co-conspirators' direction to act as references and provide false assurances to the women that, if they filmed a pornographic video, the video would not be posted online. Some women were allegedly not permitted to leave the shooting locations until the videos were completed, others were allegedly forced to perform sex acts they had declined to perform, and some women were allegedly sexually assaulted. Pratt's pornography websites generated more than $17 million U.S. dollars in revenue. A federal arrest warrant was issued for Pratt in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, on November 6, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

That evening, Negrete attended a family celebration and at approximately 5:30 PM went for a walk on County Road 545 S. After approximately 30 minutes of Negrete being gone, her family began searching for her, to no avail. Ann, as her family called her, was wearing a white sweatshirt with pink heart and green trim, light blue jeans with a hole in one knee, white and blue tennis shoes, and a red and black head scarf. Negrete was reported to have been wearing a jewelry piece with ruby and emerald stone, trimmed with diamonds and wrist bracelet with \"Ann\" spelled out with diamonds.

The roads in that area of northern New Hampshire were snow-covered at the time. Murray was not present at the crash scene when police arrived and has not been seen nor heard from since. Murray was last seen on surveillance footage earlier in the day at an ATM wearing a dark jacket and jeans. Prior to that, Murray had left the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she was studying nursing. Murray did not share with others her pending trip to New Hampshire, which was about 2.5 hours away. Murray received prior education at the United States Military Academy at West Point, was an avid runner, and enjoyed hiking in the White Mountains.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

After the fire was extinguished at the residence, Maggie Long's remains were discovered by fire rescue personnel. The El Paso County Coroner's Office later ruled her death a homicide. Long was 17 years old at the time of her death. Investigative efforts at the scene revealed a physical altercation took place between\u00a0Long and her assailants before the fire started. The suspects stole a Beretta handgun, an AK-47-style rifle, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, a green safe, and jade figurines.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

The following day, in the early morning hours of April 10, 2020, the Chabad of Huntsville, located at 1908 Parkhill Road SE, Huntsville, Alabama, was vandalized with similar anti-Semitic graffiti. Surveillance camera footage indicated the vandalisms were perpetrated by the same individual. The individual walked with a pronounced, distinct limp and appeared to have a prosthetic left leg. The individual may have been driving an early model Toyota Prius, light in color. Prior to the vandalizations, on April 4, 2020, the individual was seen walking on residential streets near the Chabad of Huntsville in the Blossomwood neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Birmingham Field Office and the Huntsville Police Department are attempting to identify the individual responsible for the damage to these religious properties. Damage exceeding $5,000 to religious property is a felony offense.</p>",

Raush suffers from mental illness and has had contact with law enforcement on multiple occasions due to mental health episodes. Some of this law enforcement contact occurred on highways and near railroad tracks while Philip was on foot. Record checks indicate law enforcement agencies in Southern California queried Raush between January 2, 2014, and October 17, 2014, but the reasons for these queries and whether Raush was physically present at the time are unknown. Investigators have utilized Raush\u2019s name and social security in efforts to locate him in a mental health or corrections facility to no avail. Investigators ask that all agencies review their cases to identify any possible contact with an individual matching the description of Raush.</p>",

The body was discovered on the levee that ran in the Baxter Creek and bordered the 51st Street Trail, the San Francisco Bay Trail, and the Second Hoffman March Bridge. The victim was 5\u20197\u201d and weighed 142 pounds.. He had what appeared to be a faded, small tattoo on his back (unknown what the tattoo shows), as well as extensive gold dental work.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>During the autopsy, he was found to have suffered from Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had several medications in his system, including ones used typically as antidepressants and short-term insomnia relief. He also had a stent in the left anterior descending artery of his heart. Investigators believe the victim may be from outside the country as his stent did not have a serial number or any identifiers, which is uncharacteristic for the United States for what the victim\u2019s suspected age is.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

On July 4, 1981, David's dismembered remains began to be discovered in and along the Snake River six miles west of Clarkston, Washington, in an area just west of Silcott Island. Some, but not all, of the remains were recovered elsewhere along the river the next day. The remains had been concealed inside black plastic bags\u00a0and some of the body parts were wrapped in pages from various April 1981 editions of the local newspaper. David\u2019s blue 10-speed bicycle, clothing, and other personal items were never recovered.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Early in the investigation, multiple individuals traveling Highway 95 on the day of David\u2019s disappearance reported seeing a female cyclist matching David\u2019s description being approached by a man driving a brown van on the west, or southbound, side of the highway just outside Genesee, Idaho. Additional reports suggest the same man also spoke with or approached different female cyclists or pedestrians along Highway 95 the same day.\u00a0</p>",

When Carlos 'N Charlie's was closing around 1:00 a.m., some of the group headed back to the Holiday Inn where they were staying, and others in the group gathered at various area bars. Holloway was last seen around 1:30 a.m. leaving the area in a silver Honda with three young males, Joran van der Sloot, Deepak Kalpoe, and Satish Kalpoe. Holloway did not return to her hotel room, and her personal belongings remained in her room. On the morning of May 30, 2005, when the Mountain Brook group was scheduled to meet in the lobby of the hotel in preparation for their departure from Aruba, Holloway never joined them. The Mountain Brook group returned to the United States, however Holloway's whereabouts remain unknown.</p>",

		"details": "<p>The FBI is seeking the public\u2019s assistance in identifying alleged victims of convicted killer Curtis Dean Anderson, who died while serving his prison term on December 9, 2007.</p>\r\n<p>Anderson was convicted and sentenced to over 300 years in prison for the 1999 kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Xiana Fairchild in Vallejo, California, and other crimes. He was captured after one of his kidnap victims was able to escape. Anderson was interviewed by FBI agents in November of 2007, and confessed to murdering eight victims in the United States, including Fairchild and 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia of Pinole, California. Anderson also confessed to two murders in Mexico, but did not provide any information on those victims.</p>\r\n<p>The following is a list of the stateside victims\u2019 descriptions given by Anderson in chronological order:</p>\r\n<p>Late 1984: Victim #1 was described as a female \"runaway\" in her late teens/early 20s. Anderson allegedly met and killed her and then disposed of her body near a local swimming hole in Marysville, California. Victim #2 was a young female hitchhiker in her late teens, whom Anderson claimed he picked up on a road near the northeast side of Clearlake a few days after the death of Victim #1.</p>\r\n<p>Early 1985: Victim #3 was a female in her late teens, also residing in the Marysville area, who was possibly a runaway from Oregon.</p>\r\n<p>November 1986: Victim #4 was about 21 years old. She was a light-skinned Black female whom Anderson met in a bar frequented by African-Americans located in the East Bay, off Interstate-80 on San Pablo Avenue. He claimed this occurred about 10 days after he was paroled from San Quentin State Prison. Anderson allegedly killed her and disposed of the body in the Oakland hills.</p>\r\n<p>June 1988: Victim #5 was Amber Swartz-Garcia, who Anderson said was standing on a street in Pinole, California, when he physically forced her into his car. He eventually murdered her in Arizona.</p>\r\n<p>1988/1989: Victim #6 was allegedly a Navajo Indian woman about 23 to 24 years old. Anderson claimed he picked her up coming out of a bar near 5th or 6th Street in Benicia, California. He said he then killed her near Benson, Arizona.</p>\r\n<p>In 1989, Anderson received a ticket while driving a two-door, brown, 1977 Chevy sedan.</p>\r\n<p>February or March 1997: Victim #7 was a Black/Hispanic female in her early 20s with noticeable \"junkie tracks\" on her arms who went by the name \u201cRosie\u201d. Anderson allegedly met her at \u201cThe Bears\u201d bar, which he described as being frequented by Hispanics. This bar was located under Highway 87 in San Jose, California, near a bowling alley. After killing her, he allegedly disposed of her body near the Ben Lomand turnoff near Santa Cruz, California. During this incident, Anderson stated he had been driving a black Toyota truck from his \u201cParts Company\u201d.</p>\r\n<p>December 1999: Victim #8 was Xiana Fairchild, who disappeared on December 9, 1999.</p>",

The device, which was built using an ammunition can similar to those found on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, was filled halfway with black powder and detonated using a time fuse. Although no one was wounded, the device could have caused significant injury and casualties if people had been close to the blast.</p>\r\n<p>The suspect rode a blue \"Ross\" bicycle west on 37th Street, took a right heading north on Sixth Avenue, and made a left heading west on 47th Street before turning left to head south on Seventh Avenue. The suspect got off the bike near the recruiting station at West 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue, placed the explosive device at the recruiting station, lit a fuse, returned to the bicycle, and fled the scene. The suspect rode the bike south on Broadway before making a left on 38th Street. The bike was later recovered in a dumpster near Madison Avenue and 38th Street.</p>\r\n<p>Although the suspect appears to be working alone, he or she may have had a lookout or surveillance team of as many as five individuals located in Times Square at the time the device was placed. The suspect was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt and pants of an unknown color. The height, weight, age, sex, and race of the suspect are unknown.</p>\r\n<p>Details of this bombing are similar to those of two other unsolved bombings that occurred in New York City, one at the British Consulate in May of 2005, and the other at the Mexican Consulate in October of 2007. All of the devices were delivered by an individual on a bicycle and were detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. The incidents may be connected.</p>",

McCool solicited and induced members of the public to invest approximately $10 million in Brixon by making fraudulent and misleading representations concerning how the money would be used, the rates of return, the security of the investments, and their own qualifications to conduct such investments.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Reportedly, McCool promised investors that their money would be invested in European investment programs and used as reserves for high-yield insurance company portfolio investments. Investors were told that Brixon would generate returns of 10 percent per month. Investors were also falsely promised that they could not lose their principal investment because the principal was insured by the State Bar of California. Furthermore, McCool was represented to investors as a banking expert who successfully managed a large private trust in Europe before operating Brixon.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, McCool reportedly failed to disclose to investors that he did not invest money for the benefit of the investors; instead, he allegedly converted a substantial portion of the invested money for personal use and used new funds received by Brixon to make payments to earlier investors. Additionally, investors' money was never insured against loss. When Brixon failed to make promised payments to investors, McCool responded by telling investors that the money was tied up in Europe due to the United States Patriot Act and various international banking problems.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, 2006, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California after McCool was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud.\u00a0</p>",

The two became embroiled in a very lengthy and aggressive custody-visitation dispute in the San Diego Family Court. In early November of 2004, the mother reportedly mentioned to the father that she and the children were planning a 2-week vacation in New Zealand. He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004.\u00a0 At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /><br />On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction. A federal arrest warrant was subsequently issued on February 4, 2005, in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, charging Fernandez with international parental kidnapping.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

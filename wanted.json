Although no one was wounded, the device could have caused significant injury and casualties if people had been close to the blast.</p>\r\n<p>The suspect rode a blue \"Ross\" bicycle west on 37th Street, took a right heading north on Sixth Avenue, and made a left heading west on 47th Street before turning left to head south on Seventh Avenue. The suspect got off the bike near the recruiting station at West 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue, placed the explosive device at the recruiting station, lit a fuse, returned to the bicycle, and fled the scene. The suspect rode the bike south on Broadway before making a left on 38th Street. The bike was later recovered in a dumpster near Madison Avenue and 38th Street.</p>\r\n<p>Although the suspect appears to be working alone, he or she may have had a lookout or surveillance team of as many as five individuals located in Times Square at the time the device was placed. The suspect was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt and pants of an unknown color. The height, weight, age, sex, and race of the suspect are unknown.</p>\r\n<p>Details of this bombing are similar to those of two other unsolved bombings that occurred in New York City, one at the British Consulate in May of 2005, and the other at the Mexican Consulate in October of 2007. All of the devices were delivered by an individual on a bicycle and were detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. The incidents may be connected.</p>",

Pratt and a co-conspirator owned and operated a pornography production company and online pornography websites, \"GirlsDoPorn\" and \"GirlsDoToys.\"\u00a0Pratt\u00a0and his co-conspirators\u00a0allegedly recruited young women from around the United States by posting advertisements for clothed modeling jobs on the Internet.\u00a0Pratt\u00a0and his co-conspirators advised the women responding to the ads that the jobs were in fact for pornographic videos and that they would be paid between $3,000 to $5,000 U.S. dollars for a one-day video shoot. To persuade the women to participate, Pratt\u00a0and his co-conspirators\u00a0allegedly convinced the women they would remain anonymous, that their videos\u00a0\u200bwould be provided to private collectors on DVD,\u00a0and would not be posted on the Internet.\u00a0Pratt\u00a0allegedly paid other young women working at his direction to act as references or provide false assurances to the women that, if they filmed a video, the video would not be posted online.\u00a0Some\u00a0\u200bwomen\u00a0were not permitted to leave the shooting locations until the videos were made\u00a0\u200band\u00a0\u200bothers\u00a0were allegedly forced to perform certain sex acts they had declined to do.

Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim\u2019s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",

McCool solicited and induced members of the public to invest approximately $10 million in Brixon by making fraudulent and misleading representations concerning how the money would be used, the rates of return, the security of the investments, and their own qualifications to conduct such investments.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Reportedly, McCool promised investors that their money would be invested in European investment programs and used as reserves for high-yield insurance company portfolio investments. Investors were told that Brixon would generate returns of 10 percent per month. Investors were also falsely promised that they could not lose their principal investment because the principal was insured by the State Bar of California. Furthermore, McCool was represented to investors as a banking expert who successfully managed a large private trust in Europe before operating Brixon.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, McCool reportedly failed to disclose to investors that he did not invest money for the benefit of the investors; instead, he allegedly converted a substantial portion of the invested money for personal use and used new funds received by Brixon to make payments to earlier investors. Additionally, investors' money was never insured against loss. When Brixon failed to make promised payments to investors, McCool responded by telling investors that the money was tied up in Europe due to the United States Patriot Act and various international banking problems.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, 2006, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California after McCool was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud.\u00a0</p>",

They left the residence around 8:00 p.m. and were believed to be headed to their residence (also located in Sacramento). Norma drove a 1965 light blue Pontiac Lemans (CA Plate 254SBI, VIN: 237375K134785), which is also missing and has never been recovered. Family members, unable to contact Norma in the days following, responded to the family\u2019s residence and found all of their belongings inside, including unopened mail and a welfare check. The Houghland family has not been seen or heard from since. Norma worked as a typist. She had cesarean scars on her abdomen and had a history of suicide attempts.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

The only item missing was his U.S. passport, but it has not been used. He had recently complained of memory loss, headaches, and nosebleeds. Richard's family reported that they had received emails from Ingram with suicidal idealizations. He is a U.S. Army Reserve soldier, and a known survivalist.</p>",

		"details": "<p>On Sunday, June 17, 2012, at approximately 2200 hours, a female was sexually assaulted on the shoulder of South Foothills Hwy (Hwy 93), just south of Boulder city limits. The victim was lost and had stopped on the highway shoulder to update her GPS. The offender approached her driver\u2019s side window and asked if she was okay. He then ordered her out of the vehicle and displayed a handgun, possibly a small compact, black, semi-automatic. The suspect ordered the victim to the backseat of his vehicle, described as a late model Jeep Cherokee, or similar, gray or blue in color with cloth fabric. The victim was sexually assaulted in the backseat of the suspect\u2019s vehicle. After the assault, the victim was ordered out of the car and left at the side of the road. The suspect was last seen making a U-turn and driving back towards Boulder.</p>\r\n<p>The victim did not recall seeing the suspect\u2019s vehicle on the shoulder when she first stopped and did not see the suspect\u2019s vehicle pull up behind her. The description of the suspect is vague, and it is believed he was a white male, approximately 5\u201911\u201d in height.</p>\r\n<p>After further interviews with the victim, she was able to provide additional details about the offender: a white male with longer; bondish arm hair. He had rough hands similar to a person who works with his hands. She described a tattoo on his upper left arm, possibly green in color, circle shape. She was only able to see the lower portion of the tattoo, due to a short-sleeve shirt covering the rest of the tattoo.</p>",

Muegge had stab wounds and blunt force injuries on her head and neck. A knife was found in the living room, where the fire is believed to have been ignited by an accelerant. Muegge\u2019s underwear was down around her knees; yet there were no signs of a sexual assault. In addition, a large sum of money was left in the house, however, the victim\u2019s cell phone and wallet were never located.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two past incidents of possible interest involving Muegge occurred in the years prior to her murder, which are detailed as follows: On September 3, 2003, Muegge reported a suspicious white male in his 50s named Frank,\r\nwhom she had met through a friend. The report indicated she did not feel comfortable with this man on her property, but no further information or reports were ever documented. Separately on February 12, 2006, Muegge\r\nreported that two of her bottle-fed sheep had been shot. It was later determined that the sheep had been shot with a 22 caliber rifle.<p>\r\n\r\n",

While Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator, others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised web sites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others utilized to steal money from the victims\u2019 bank accounts.

Diaz-Juarez, reportedly one of the most violent individuals in the organization, is the only remaining fugitive in the case.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>As reported to the FBI, it is alleged that the following criminal activities occurred. The criminal acts in the conspiracy involve acts committed by Diaz-Juarez and others against undocumented Mexican women and children.

Diaz-Juarez is one of these pimps. During the investigation, it was revealed that some women and girls were compelled into performing commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, coercion, or a combination thereof, including the use of locked rooms to maintain control over the young women and girls. Diaz-Juarez used force and/or violence to punish and control young females he prostituted in the Houston area.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2013, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, after Diaz-Juarez was charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy and conspiracy to harbor illegal aliens.</p>",

Reports in this case allege the following: On July 5, 1997, Francisco Molina-Neave and his girlfriend attended a holiday party in the Denver Metro area. While driving home from the party, Molina-Neave, who was seated in the front passenger seat, began punching his girlfriend as she was driving. She stopped the car and pulled over. Molina-Neave got out and walked around to the driver\u2019s side of the car where he continued to beat his girlfriend.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The assault continued until a passer-by showed up and ran over to the girlfriend. Molina-Neave then fled the area. The passer-by flagged down a vehicle occupied by additional witnesses who reportedly saw the beating. The passer-by asked the witnesses in the car to attempt to locate the suspect. They agreed to help and spotted Molina-Neave a short distance away. They told Molina-Neave to stop and that they had called the police. The suspect fled down an alley as police arrived. While setting up the perimeter the police heard two gunshots fired from the alley where the suspect was last seen. The gunshots were fired by two different guns. The officers observed the witness vehicle speed out of the alley. The witnesses were screaming that the same suspect, along with another Hispanic male, had allegedly shot at them and their vehicle. One of the occupants in the vehicle was screaming that she had been shot as well.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 1999, a jury found Francisco Molina-Neave guilty on charges of first degree assault, attempted first degree assault, prohibited use of a weapon, and third degree assault. Molina-Neave fled from the courtroom as the verdict was read. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. On May 17, 2006, Francisco Molina-Neave was arrested on the warrant from Denver in San Antonio, Texas. He refused extradition, and a Texas court allowed him to post bond pending his extradition appeal. The suspect failed to appear and was arrested in mid-May of 2007. The Texas court set his bond for one million dollars. Molina-Neave posted the bond and was released. His appeal was denied on October 4, 2007, and he fled again. On March 13, 2008, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Molina-Neave, and he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>",

After receiving money from the vault, Ghumman and Zamir exited the bank. On February 14, 2017, federal arrest warrants were issued for both Ghumman and Zamir in the United States District Court, Western District of New York, Buffalo, New York, after they were both charged with bank robbery, entering a bank with intent to commit a larceny, and bank larceny.</p>",

That organization allegedly is responsible for the delivery of more than one-hundred kilograms of cocaine in Arkansas.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On May 2, 2013, a federal indictment was handed down by a Federal Grand Jury for the United States District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, charging Ramos-Rangel with multiple drug offenses, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, distribution of cocaine, and use of a telephone to facilitate a drug-trafficking crime. On that same day, a federal warrant was issued in Arkansas for Ramos-Rangel's arrest. On June 6, 2013, another federal warrant was issued for Ramos-Rangel's arrest following additional federal drug charges (superseding indictment) obtained for other members of Ramos-Rangel's conspiracy. Ramos-Rangel is also facing federal drug charges in Texas.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The federal indictments resulted from a large-scale investigation, codenamed Operation Dirty Bird, that disrupted cocaine and narcotics trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Multi-tons of cocaine and marijuana are alleged to have been trafficked and distributed throughout the United States, in connection with Ramos-Rangel's alleged drug-trafficking activities.</p>",

Morales was severely injured, taken to a hospital, and arrested. Due to his injuries, Morales was held at the Bellevue Hospital prison ward in New York City until his potential transfer to federal prison. Morales escaped from Bellevue Hospital and fled to Mexico, where he was captured in May of 1983. He was imprisoned in Mexico, but eventually handed over to Cuban authorities and is believed to still be in that country.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Morales was convicted on February 28, 1979, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York of possession of explosives (pipe bombs) and possession and transportation in interstate commerce of pipe bombs and a sawed off shotgun. Morales was sentenced to ten years in prison and five years probation.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On June 1, 1979, Morales was charged with unlawful interstate flight to avoid prosecution for the crime of escape.</p>",

A member of the Black Panthers, Kerkow and an accomplice claimed they had a bomb in an attache case and demanded $500,000. After allowing the 97 passengers to get off the plane in San Francisco, California, Kerkow and her accomplice flew to Algeria where they were granted political asylum. On January 25, 1975, the two hijackers, using fake passports, were arrested on illegal entry charges in France. Kerkow's accomplice was eventually extradited to the United States, but Kerkow's whereabouts remain unknown. A federal arrest warrant was issued for Kerkow in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, on June 5, 1972, after she was charged with air piracy.</p>",

		"details": "<p>On September 12, 1980, a 32-year-old male and his 22-year-old female companion traveled from their home state of Missouri to Iowa for a weekend getaway. They checked into the Amana Holiday Inn (along Interstate 80, just outside of Williamsburg) that evening and were found deceased the following afternoon by the motel maid. The victims had been stabbed to death, possibly with an axe or hatchet that had a 3 \u00bd inch blade. The male victim had seven stab wounds to his arms, hands, face, head, and neck/throat (including possible defensive wounds to his hands). The female victim had twelve stab wounds to her face, head, and neck/throat. There were no signs of forced entry into the motel room and no obvious signs of sexual assault. The victims were in bed, face-down, partly under the covers. The male victim was wearing only his underwear and the female victim was fully clothed. The victims\u2019 personal belongings were scattered and approximately $200 was taken. Small pieces of a bar of bath soap were on the floor next to the bed. The word \"this\" was printed on the bathroom door, possibly using the bar of soap, and toothpaste was squeezed into the bathtub. Investigators have identified two cases with similarities to the instant case: the homicide of a 25-year-old male in Galesburg, Illinois, on June 24,1980 and the homicide of a 23-year-old male in Meridian, Mississippi on\u00a0October\u00a026, 1970. Like the instant case, the Galesburg and Meridian victims were away from home and staying in a motel room just off a busy Interstate. Additionally, in all three cases, toothpaste was found in an unusual location at the crime scene, the weapon used is believed to be a machete or sort of axe/hatchet, and money was taken.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>If you have information relevant to this investigation, or know of other cases that resemble the details of this homicide (e.g., victim(s) was killed in a motel room near a busy interstate; weapon used was an axe, hatchet, or machete; toothpaste or soap was found in an unusual location at the crime scene; writing or drawings were left at the crime scene), please contact the agency below.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>&lt;p&gt;To provide or request additional information, please contact:\u00a0Captain Todd\u00a0Sauerbrei, Iowa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Iowa, (319) 642-7307, TSauerbrei@iowacosheriff.org - - FBI\u00a0ViCAP, (800) 634-4097, vicap@fbi.gov\u00a0</p>",

Investigation has revealed that Mr. Holder arrived at the Dollar General Store in the early morning hours of October 14, 2016, parked his vehicle, and entered the store through the front entrance. While inside the store, Mr. Holder gathered the overnight cash deposits and placed them inside of a grey and black soft-sided cooler. Mr. Holder exited the business roughly 15 minutes later, and prepared to depart the premises in his vehicle; at which time an unknown subject is observed, on-camera in the parking lot, and fires multiple rounds at the victim. The unknown subject initially flees, then returns and opens the door to the victim\u2019s vehicle. The grey and black soft-sided cooler was not located at the scene upon the officers' arrival.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

The flight exploded shortly after takeoff, killing all 21 people on board. Authorities are seeking information that may pertain to possible suspect(s) and the crime that occurred aboard this flight. All deceased passengers and crew in the Flight 00901 crash were claimed, except one. A body has possibly been identified as Ali Hawa Jamal. He is suspected of carrying the bomb aboard the aircraft.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>According to reports, an unidentified Middle Eastern male used the stolen credit card of a US citizen to rent a Mazda 4x4 at a Vantage Rent-a-Car located in Panama City, Panama, on May 27, 1994. The next day the same unidentified individual called the car rental agency and stated he wanted to rent a second car, a Jeep Cherokee 4x4, as his friend was using the initial car that was rented. The individual charged both cars to the stolen credit card. Both cars were later found abandoned near Tocumen Airport in Panama City, Panama.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On\u00a0 May 28, 1994,\u00a0 it was further reported that possibly the same Middle Eastern male utilizing the same stolen credit card, purchased a two-line telephone system from a Panamanian business. Ali Hawa Jamal had a Motorola Radio P-500 radio with him during the ill-fated flight of Alas Chiricanas Airlines Flight 00901.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>It is unknown if the unknown Middle Eastern males were associates of Ali Hawa Jamal. The unknown males are believed to have traveled to Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Lebanon. It is suspected that the Middle Eastern males were in contact with individuals in the region that has been linked to weapons traffickers. The Sidon, Lebanon based terrorist group Ansar Allah expressed support for the bombing through multiple media outlets. It is suspected that the attack was linked\u00a0 to a terrorist group or groups allied with Ansar Allah's political beliefs.</p>",

Pamela was 32 years-old, was 5\u20196\u201d tall, weighed 120 pounds, and had shoulder-length brown hair. She was dressed in a black miniskirt and tan panty hose (no shoes or socks). She was last seen at the Union 76 Truck Stop, ten miles north along I65. She was sexually assaulted and died as a result of manual strangulation. She was 20 weeks pregnant at the time of her death.</p>\r\n<p>On March 1, 1992, the unidentified nude remains of a Hispanic/Latina (based on ancestral DNA) female were found off the westbound lane of Interstate 80 (I80), along the bottom of a slope, at the rest area known as \u201cBitter Creek\u201d, 40 miles east of Rock Springs, WY. The victim was between 24 to 32 years old, was 5\u20198\u201d tall, weighed130 pounds, and had collar-length brown hair. She had a long vertical scar on her abdomen, potentially a caesarean scar, and a red rose tattoo with what appears to be Chinese characters between the stem and the right leaf on her right breast. The cause of victim\u2019s death could not be determined; however, due to the circumstances on how and where victim\u2019s body was recovered this case is considered a homicide. The victim had evidence of trauma to her neck, face, and jaw as well as a potential puncture wound of the left nostril, which penetrated her spheroid bone. It could not be determined if this wound was by the offender or if it was the result of postmortem recovery. (Refer to figures 1 and 2 and National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) database, case report numbers UP8894.</p>\r\n<p>On April 13, 1992, the unidentified remains of a White female were found in a ditch along southbound Interstate 90 (I90), approximately five miles south of the WY and Montana (MT) state line, in Sheridan, WY. The victim was between 17 and 23 years old, was 5\u20195\u201d tall, weighed 115 pounds, and had shoulder-length sun-bleached brown hair. The victim was fully clothed with the exception of her shoes and socks, which were never recovered. She wore size five Kayo of California medium blue jeans with a white plastic belt that had a gold-colored buckle; a size large Sauci brand blue and white checkered midriff blouse with pearl-colored ornamental buttons; a size 38C Chic brand light blue lacy bra, and size 5 to 6 Bill Blass brand dark blue and pink paisley print bikini panties. The victim was approximately 10 weeks pregnant at the time of her death. The cause of victim\u2019s death could not be determined; however, due to the circumstances on how and where victim\u2019s body was recovered this case is considered a homicide. (Refer to figures 3 and 4 and NamUs database, case report number UP9970.)</p>\r\n<p><br />The public is encouraged to provide any information that could assist in identifying the victims and the perpetrator responsible for their deaths.</p>",

Raush was reported missing on January 31, 2014, when his significant other was unable to locate him. Raush suffers from mental illness and has had contact with law enforcement on multiple occasions due to mental health episodes. Some of this law enforcement contact occurred on highways and near railroad tracks while Philip was on foot. Record checks indicate law enforcement agencies in Southern California queried Raush between January 2, 2014, and October 17, 2014, but the reasons for these queries and whether Raush was physically present at the time are unknown. Investigators have utilized Raush\u2019s name and social security in efforts to locate him in a mental health or corrections facility to no avail. Investigators ask that all agencies review their cases to identify any possible contact with an individual matching the description of Raush.</p>",

On July 4, 1981, David's dismembered remains began to be discovered in and along the Snake River six miles west of Clarkston, Washington, in an area just west of Silcott Island. Some, but not all, of the remains were recovered elsewhere along the river the next day. The remains had been concealed inside black plastic bags\u00a0and some of the body parts were wrapped in pages from various April 1981 editions of the local newspaper. David\u2019s blue 10-speed bicycle, clothing, and other personal items were never recovered.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Early in the investigation, multiple individuals traveling Highway 95 on the day of David\u2019s disappearance reported seeing a female cyclist matching David\u2019s description being approached by a man driving a brown van on the west, or southbound, side of the highway just outside Genesee, Idaho. Additional reports suggest the same man also spoke with or approached different female cyclists or pedestrians along Highway 95 the same day.\u00a0</p>",

Holloway was last seen around 1:30 a.m. leaving the area in a silver Honda with three young males, Joran van der Sloot, Deepak Kalpoe, and Satish Kalpoe. Holloway did not return to her hotel room, and her personal belongings remained in her room. On the morning of May 30, 2005, when the Mountain Brook group was scheduled to meet in the lobby of the hotel in preparation for their departure from Aruba, Holloway never joined them.

		"details": "<p>The FBI is seeking the public\u2019s assistance in identifying alleged victims of convicted killer Curtis Dean Anderson, who died while serving his prison term on December 9, 2007.</p>\r\n<p>Anderson was convicted and sentenced to over 300 years in prison for the 1999 kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Xiana Fairchild in Vallejo, California, and other crimes. He was captured after one of his kidnap victims was able to escape. Anderson was interviewed by FBI agents in November of 2007, and confessed to murdering eight victims in the United States, including Fairchild and 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia of Pinole, California. Anderson also confessed to two murders in Mexico, but did not provide any information on those victims.</p>\r\n<p>The following is a list of the stateside victims\u2019 descriptions given by Anderson in chronological order:</p>\r\n<p>Late 1984: Victim #1 was described as a female \"runaway\" in her late teens/early 20s. Anderson allegedly met and killed her and then disposed of her body near a local swimming hole in Marysville, California. Victim #2 was a young female hitchhiker in her late teens, whom Anderson claimed he picked up on a road near the northeast side of Clearlake a few days after the death of Victim #1.</p>\r\n<p>Early 1985: Victim #3 was a female in her late teens, also residing in the Marysville area, who was possibly a runaway from Oregon.</p>\r\n<p>November 1986: Victim #4 was about 21 years old. She was a light-skinned Black female whom Anderson met in a bar frequented by African-Americans located in the East Bay, off Interstate-80 on San Pablo Avenue. He claimed this occurred about 10 days after he was paroled from San Quentin State Prison. Anderson allegedly killed her and disposed of the body in the Oakland hills.</p>\r\n<p>June 1988: Victim #5 was Amber Swartz-Garcia, who Anderson said was standing on a street in Pinole, California, when he physically forced her into his car. He eventually murdered her in Arizona.</p>\r\n<p>1988/1989: Victim #6 was allegedly a Navajo Indian woman about 23 to 24 years old. Anderson claimed he picked her up coming out of a bar near 5th or 6th Street in Benicia, California. He said he then killed her near Benson, Arizona.</p>\r\n<p>In 1989, Anderson received a ticket while driving a two-door, brown, 1977 Chevy sedan.</p>\r\n<p>February or March 1997: Victim #7 was a Black/Hispanic female in her early 20s with noticeable \"junkie tracks\" on her arms who went by the name \u201cRosie\u201d. Anderson allegedly met her at \u201cThe Bears\u201d bar, which he described as being frequented by Hispanics. This bar was located under Highway 87 in San Jose, California, near a bowling alley. After killing her, he allegedly disposed of her body near the Ben Lomand turnoff near Santa Cruz, California. During this incident, Anderson stated he had been driving a black Toyota truck from his \u201cParts Company\u201d.</p>\r\n<p>December 1999: Victim #8 was Xiana Fairchild, who disappeared on December 9, 1999.</p>",

The two became embroiled in a very lengthy and aggressive custody-visitation dispute in the San Diego Family Court. In early November of 2004, the mother reportedly mentioned to the father that she and the children were planning a 2-week vacation in New Zealand. He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004.\u00a0 At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /><br />On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction. A federal arrest warrant was subsequently issued on February 4, 2005, in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, charging Fernandez with international parental kidnapping.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

Michael's father, Miguel Reyes, authorized the foreign travel with the agreement that Francesconi would return to the United States with their son. However, Francesconi never returned to the United States and ceased all contact with Reyes. Michael was located by Interpol in Argentina.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On November 27, 2009, the Civil Court, pursuant to the Hague Convention, ordered the return of Michael to the United States. On December 21, 2010, the Supreme Court of Argentina upheld the decision of the Civil Court and ordered the return of Michael to the United States. That order has yet to be executed, and the child remains in Argentina.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2012, the Florida Miami-Dade Family Court issued a final judgment, finding Reyes to be Michael's natural and biological father, and ordered physical and legal custody of Michael to Reyes. On June 25, 2013, Francesconi was indicted for international parental kidnapping by a Federal Grand Jury for the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida. That same day, a federal warrant was issued for Francesconi's arrest.</p>",
